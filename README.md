# BTC-USDT Crypto Market Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains analysis and modeling of the BTC-USDT cryptocurrency market, focusing on price trends, trading strategies, and predictive insights. It was prepared as part of the KDSH 2024 Problem Statement, combining data exploration, visualization, and model-building in Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository Structure
```
BTC-USDT-Crypto-Market-main/
│── FINAL.ipynb          # Main Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
│── KDSH 2024 - PS.pdf   # Original problem statement / reference
│── README.md            # Project documentation (this file)
```

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/BTC-USDT-Crypto-Market-main.git
   cd BTC-USDT-Crypto-Market-main
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *If `requirements.txt` is missing, install common data-science libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow/pytorch depending on the notebook.*

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook FINAL.ipynb
```

Inside the notebook, you will find:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – handling missing values, feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualizations of BTC price movement, volatility, and volume trends
- Modeling – predictive approaches (e.g., regression, ML/DL models depending on notebook implementation)
- Evaluation – performance metrics and insights

## Key Features
- Analysis of BTC-USDT market behavior
- Visual exploration of trends and anomalies
- Implementation of predictive models for market forecasting
- Discussion of findings in context of the KDSH 2024 problem statement

## References
